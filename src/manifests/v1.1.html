        Participants of the EEGG Project agree to comply with this Manifesto: https://manifesto.eegg.foundation
    </li>
    <li>
        Participants of the EEGG Project acknowledge that a special form of simultaneous ownership of tangible and intangible property has been formed. We call this form of ownership the EEGG.
    </li>
    <li>
        The principle of the EEGG Project is EEGG trading in the form of a blockchain network NFT and the EEGG.foundation technology.
    </li>
    <li>
        The EEGG.foundation technology is published as open source.
    </li>
    <li>
        The main website of the EEGG Project is https://eegg.foundation.
    </li>
    <li>
        The EEGG.foundation technology enables the creation of galleries displaying third-party EEGGs.
    </li>
    <li>
        EEGG = ROR + NFT.
    </li>
    <li>
        An EEGG consists of a tangible object (real object of reality - ROR) located anywhere and the one and only digital image of the tangible object (non fungible token - NFT). The ROR is created by the Author.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Owner of the NFT is also the Owner of the ROR and therefore of the EEGG.
    </li>
    <li>
        The ROR is independent of the Owner's location.
    </li>
    <li>
        The ROR can be exhibited by the Exhibitor anywhere and at any time without notifying the Owner. The Exhibitor must indicate the location of the ROR.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Author may disagree with the exhibition of the ROR  in a place that is not in accordance with his beliefs.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Owner of the EEGG has the right to assume the physical possession of the ROR if he pays the necessary costs to the Exhibitor.
    </li>
    <li>
        A Prospective Purchaser of the EEGG will make an offer to purchase the NFT from the Owner of the EEGG using the EEGG.foundation technology.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Owner, Author, Exhibitor, Intermediary, and the EGGG.foundation are entitled to a commission set forth at the creation of the EEGG.
    </li>
    <li>
        Physical destruction of the ROR does not affect the ownership of the NFT.
    </li>
    <li>
        This Manifesto must be visibly displayed on the ROR, either as text or a link.
    </li>
    <li>
        Terms: Author, Owner, Prospective Purchaser, Exhibitor, Participant, Commission, Gallery, EEGG.foundation, Marketplace, Project, Technologie, Smart Contracts.
