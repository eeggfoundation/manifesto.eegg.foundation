                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Participants of the EEGG.gallery Project agree to comply with this Manifesto
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Participants of the EEGG.gallery Project acknowledge that a special form of simultaneous ownership of
                        tangible and intangible property has been formed. We call this form of ownership the EEGG.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The principle of the EEGG.gallery Project is EEGG trading in the form of a blockchain network NFT.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The EEGG.gallery Project's main website is <a href="https://eegg.gallery" target="_blank">https://www.eegg.gallery</a>, where all Participants register.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An EEGG consists of a tangible object (real object of reality - ROR) located anywhere and the one and
                        only digital image of the tangible object (non fungible token - NFT). The ROR is created by the Author.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Owner of the NFT is also the Owner of the ROR and therefore of the EEGG.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each EEGG has its own webpage. The address appears in the form of a URL (http://eegg.gallery/id_eeggs),
                        either as a text or as a QR code, and is located on the ROR.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The ROR is independent of the Owner's location.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The ROR can be exhibited by the Exhibitor anywhere and at any time without notifying the Owner. The
                        Exhibitor must indicate on the EEGG's webpage the location of the ROR.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Author may disagree with the exhibition of the ROR in a place that is not in accordance with his beliefs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Owner of the EEGG has the right to assume the physical possession of the ROR if he pays the necessary costs to the Exhibitor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A Prospective Purchaser of the EEGG will make an offer to purchase the NFT from the Owner of the EEGG through the EEGG's webpage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Owner, Author, and the Exhibitor of the EEGG are entitled to a commission set forth at the creation of the EEGG.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Physical destruction of the ROR does not affect the ownership of the NFT.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This Manifesto must be visibly displayed on the ROR.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Terms: Author, Owner, Prospective Purchaser, Exhibitor, Participant, Commission, EEGG.gallery, Marketplace, Project.
